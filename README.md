# Plagiarism-Detector
In this project, I built a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeled that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is to a provided source text. Project material:  https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies.
